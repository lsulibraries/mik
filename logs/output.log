He is married to Dorothy Presley, a formidable teacher in the Black community, and his father was the late J.E. Presley, the noted one-armed barber who operated the barbershop at the Ape yard for nearly 50 years. Mr. Presley's interview provides a look at subtle feelings of growing up during segregation. \n\nThe beginning of this tape includes piano music played by Mrs. Dorothy Presley, who shares some of the songs played for her students during her early days of teaching to capture their attention. Mrs. Presley's piano playing illustrates that many Black teachers were not trained in teaching methodology and were left to improvise, the better one was able to improvise the better one was seen as a good teacher. This is particularly so in the very early days of Black education when young adults taught community schools having only completed 8th grade.</abstract></relatedItem>\"","dom":"[object] (DOMDocument: {})"},"severity":2,"file":"DOMDocument::loadXML(): attributes construct error in Entity, line: 1","line":"/vagrant/mik/src/metadatamanipulators/AddContentdmData.php"} []
